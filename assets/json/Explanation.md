This is a JSON representation of a Postman collection, which is a set of HTTP requests that can be organized into folders and executed together. Let's break down the structure:

- `"info"`: Metadata about the collection, including its name, Postman ID, schema, and links related to it.
  - `"name"`: Name of the collection, in this case, "hosted AdProject".
  - `"schema"`: Specifies the schema version of the collection.
  - `"collection_link"`: Link to the collection in Postman's workspace.

- `"item"`: An array containing individual requests or folders within the collection.
  - Each object within `"item"` represents a request or a folder.
  - `"name"`: Name of the request or folder.
  - `"request"`: Details of the HTTP request.
    - `"method"`: HTTP method (e.g., POST, GET).
    - `"header"`: Array of headers for the request.
    - `"body"`: Details about the request body, including the mode and content.
    - `"url"`: URL of the request.
  - `"response"`: Placeholder for response details, typically populated after the request is made.

Let's go through each request:

1. **Signup**:
   - Method: POST
   - URL: https://adproject-apis.onrender.com/user/signup
   - Body: JSON data containing name, email, contact number, role, and password for signing up a user.

2. **Login**:
   - Method: POST
   - URL: https://adproject-apis.onrender.com/user/login
   - Body: JSON data containing email and password for user login.

3. **Get all user**:
   - Method: GET
   - URL: https://adproject-apis.onrender.com/user/getall
   - Retrieves all users.

4. **Reset password**:
   - Method: POST
   - URL: https://adproject-apis.onrender.com/user/resetpassword?email=aa@aa.com?email
   - Body: JSON data containing the new password.
   - Note: The URL seems to have a query parameter `email` which might be redundant. It could be clarified if it's required.

5. **Find, update, delete user**:
   - Method: GET
   - URL: https://adproject-apis.onrender.com/user/getby?id=65bfd011d5a25b4763e1bf7e
   - Body: JSON data containing user details (name, email, contact number, role, password, profile URL).
   - Protocol Profile Behavior: Disables body pruning, which means the request body will not be automatically pruned (trimmed).
